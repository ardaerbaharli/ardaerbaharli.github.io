                    <p> In this game, all the cards are dealt equally to the players. Players can't see their cards and
                        they play by playing the top card only. The objective is to have all the cards. There are 3 ways
                        to get the cards from the ground.
                    </p>
                    <p> 1- If the last played card has the same face value as the card 2 layer under, first one presses
                        collect button, gets all the cards from the ground.</p>
                    <p>2- If the last played card has the same face value as the card right under itself, first one
                        presses collect button, gets all the cards from the ground.</p>
                    <p>3- If the last played card is a special card (J, Q, K, A), next player has x chances (depending
                        on the card played) to play another special card. If they can't play special card, the player
                        who played the special card gets the all the cards on the ground.
                        (x ==> J=>1, Q=>2, K=>3, A=>4)</p>
