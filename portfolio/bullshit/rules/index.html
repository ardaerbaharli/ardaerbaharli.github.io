                    <p> This game is based on “Bullsh*t the Game Show” - The Netflix Original</p>
                    <p> “Bullsh*t the game show” has both a simple and a complicated concept!</p>
                    <p> It looks like nothing more than a few people lying and hoping that their lie won’t get detected. But as the show progresses, things get you quite rilled up. The money ladder and the shenanigans with locks will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>
                    <p> The other contestants also need to determine “Believe or Bullshit” to heighten their accuracy score. It’s all in hopes of also standing a chance to win the all fabulous million dollars.</p>
                    <p> Perfect for those little liars who want to test their lie detector skills for good! Telling the truth? That sends you straight up the money ladder!</p>
