                    <p> Speed is a game for two players.
                         In which each player tries to get rid of all of their cards first.
                          To do that, you have to play matching cards so that each card played 
                          is either one number above or one number below as the two cards on top of the center stacks. 
                          If the two cards on top of the center stacks have the same face value,
                           first player hits Speed button gives all the cards in their hand to the other players hand.
                            If both of the players don't have any matching cards, players are going to press Draw button 
                            and if only both of them are in the draw state, the cards will be drawn from center decks.
